# Pictochat
A DSi Pictochat-Styled Chatroom created with C# and WPF.

## How It Works
The communication itself is entirely made up of UDP sockets. Everything was made for a Client-To-Client connection so that anyone who is on the same network as you can use the chatrooms. It utilizes the broadcast and any IP channels using ports 24280-24283.

## Build
**TODO**
